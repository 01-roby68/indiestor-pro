.SH DESCRIPTION
indiestor native is an an Open Source storage platform for Avid project, bin and media sharing. In its basic form, it comprises of a free command line tool, which takes care of the management of both groups and users, as well as the sharing of projects and media. Incron and inotify are used to trigger the sharing transparently, its all pretty neat. Indiestor does not attempt to eumulate AECIFS or reverse engieneer Avid style bin locking. Instead it is a home centric storage solution where each editor has his/her own network home. To share a project with the group an editor must simply name a new or existing project as follows:

For avid shared projects use:
.B
 <projectname>.avid

For fodlers containning AMA volumes, legacy style FCP projects or anything else use:
.B
 <foldername>.shared

NB: Indiestor only listens to share triggers on the top level of the users home directory.

In the case of avid shares, upon detecting the
.B .avid
trigger, indiestor will automatically create and distribute a
.B .copy
version of the project to each member of the group. It can be found in the “Avid Shared Projects” folder. Media sharing is automatically enabled as soon as media exists in /<USER>/Avid MediaFiles/MXF.

When the project is open bins and content are easily exchanged via the 'sharing tree' - a network of folders, which are offered read-only to group members. An Unprotected folder is provided for conveniently exchanging bins between each user. Of course this is very different to a bona fide Avid Unity/ISIS bin locking environment. However, it is a powerful tool which provides a lot of protection for a fraction of the cost.

.B ONE GROUP LIMITATION:
At present users can only be a member of one group at a time. If we raise enough funding through sales of our GUI we'll implement multiple group membership and extended ZFS features.

.B UNSHARING:
The project owner can unshare a project by removing the share trigger. For example, by renaming the folder “episode3.avid" to “episode”3, the project owner will have removed the ".avid" trigger. In turn this will cause indiestor to unshare the project. When unsharing a project, indiestor will automatically archive the members work in editors shared folder.
.SH OPTIONS
There are seven main entities through which the commad line operates:

.B --groups, --group, --users, --user, --services --help

.IP --groups

.B -show:
Shows the list of indiestor groups. Not all groups listed in
.B /etc/group
are indiestor groups. 

.B -start-watching:
Starts indiestor-inotify watching for share triggers

.B -stop-watching:
Stops indiestor-inotify watching for share triggers

.IP --groups

.B -show -json:
JSON export of the group list (for easy plugin to GUI applications)

.IP --group <arg>
 
The
.B <arg>
argument must be an indiestor group.

.B -add:
creates a new indiestor group.

.B -delete:
deletes the named indiestor group.

.B -show-members:
shows the users in the named indiestor group.

.B -start-watching:
Starts indiestor-inotify watching for share triggers assigned to a specified group

.B -stop-watching:
Stops indiestor-inotify watching for share triggers assigned to a specified group

.B -show-watch-processes:
Displays the 2 watch processes for the specified group.

.IP --group <arg>

.B -show-watches <arg>
Displays the watch table for the arguments 'main' and 'avp'. All watches are main type unless a user attempts to trigger .avid sharing without a valid avp project file. In this case we use an 'avp' watch to monitor the situation. The project will only trigger when the .avp is appropriately named and has physical KB size.

.IP --users

.B -show:
shows the list of indiestor users.

.B COLUMNS

.B 	user: 
username

.B 	home: 
home directory for the user

.B 	locked: 
Y=yes, N=no

.B 	group: 
indiestor group for the user*

.B 	quota: 
ZFS in gigabytes

.B 	used: 
gigabytes of ZFS quota used

.B 	%used:
percentage of ZFS quota used up

.B 	samba: 
Y=has samba access, N=does not have samba access

.B 	flags: 
samba flags. Normally U=user.

.B 	conn.: 
Currently connected through samba. Y=yes. N=no.

* "-" if the user does not belong to an indiestor group.

.B  -regenerate-incrontab:
for debugging purposes. If the incrontab seems inconsistent, you can forcably regenerate it.

.B  -reshare:
reshares all triggers and updates share permission, should you need to prompt the system.

.IP --users

.B -show -json:
JSON export of the users list (for easy plugin to GUI applications)

.IP --user
.B <arg>

The
.B <arg>
argument must be an indiestor username.

.B -add: 
adds the user named to indiestor. If the user account does not exist, indiestor will create it. If the user exists, but is not an indiestor user, indiestor will add the user to the "indiestor-users" group. By default, indiestor also adds the user to Samba.

.B -delete:
removes the user named from indiestor.

.B -expel:
forcibly logs out the user named from the system.

.B -set-home <arg>:
sets the home directory for the user named to <arg>.

.B -remove-home:
only used in conjuction with the -delete action. In addition to deleting the user account, this option also deletes the user's home folder.

.B -set-group <arg>:
sets the group for the user named to the indiestor group <arg>. This indiestor group must exist already.

.B -unset-group:
removes the user named from his/her current indiestor group.

.B -set-zfs-quota  <arg>:
sets the zfs quota for the user named to <arg> gigabytes (if the home is ZFS based). Must be a valid number of gigabytes.

.B -remove-quota:
removes the ZFS quota for the user and makes his quota unlimited.

.B -set-passwd <arg>:
sets the user's password to <arg>.

.B -lock:
locks the account for the user named. This prevents the user from logging in or connecting through samba. The samba flags will contain the "D" flag. The system locks the user by writing "!" in front of the password field of the user's record in the file
.B /etc/shadow
.You can unlock the account by setting the password again with the -set-passwd <arg> action.

.B -add-to-samba:
Adds an existing user to samba. 

.IP --user <arg>:
.B -remove-from-indiestor:
Removes the user <arg> from indiestor. This action cannot be combined with other actions.

.IP --user <arg>:
.B -remove-from-samba:
Removes the user <arg> from samba. This action cannot be combined with other actions.

.IP --user <arg>:
.B -reshare:
reshares all project folders and media manually (for the specified user).

.IP --services <arg>:
.B -start-watching:
Starts indiestor watches (same as groups -start-watching)

JSON export of the servcice list (for easy plugin to GUI applications)

.IP --help:
Shows the command the synopsis.


.SH EXAMPLES
It is possible to combine multiple actions for the same entity.

For example:

.B indiestor --user john -add -set-group grp1 -passwd hello

The command above adds “john” to the system, make him a memeber of the group "grp1" and sets his password to "hello". By default, the system will create john's home folder in
.B /home/john
. You can override this default by using the -set-home <arg> option. If the target path is a ZFS storage pool indiestor will create an individual dataset for the user, although at present we only recommend using ZFS storage with windows clients.

.SH FILES
.I /etc/passwd
.RS
This is where the system stores the user records. There is a special user, which monitors the filesystem through incron.
.RE
.I /etc/group
.RS
This is where the system stores the group records. All indiestor users are registered in the indiestor-users group.
For example, all users for indiestor group "grp1" are registered in the "is_grp1" group. The "is_" prefix stands for "indiestor". special group: The indiewheel group lists the users that are allowed to execute the indiestor command besides the root user.
.RE
.I /etc/incron.allow
.RS
Must list the indienotify user. The indienotify user is the user for which incron watches the filesystem.
.RE
.I /var/spool/incron/indienotify
.RS
The incron table for the indienotify system user. The indiestor and indiestor-inotify commands regenerate this table as needed as a consequence of admin actions or as a consequence of changes in the filesystem monitored. In case of issues, use the --users -regenerate-incrontab option to regenerate this file. You can show the content of the file with the option --users -show-incrontab.
.RE
.I /etc/init.d/indiestor-watch
.RS
This init.d script starts/stops all watches. It is deployed on installation and positioned to initialise when the system boots.
.RE
.I /etc/super.tab
.RS
This file must have an entry for the indiestor and indiestor-inotify command ensuring that the indiewheel group can operate the indiestor command as root and the indienotify user to operate the indiestor-inotify command as root.
.RE
.I /etc/netatalk/Applevolumes.default
.RS
Netatalk home shares for Mac clients.
.RE
.I /etc/samba/smb.conf
.RS
Netatalk home shares for Windows clients.
.RE
.I /etc/samba/smb.conf
.RS
Must list indiestor shares.
.RE
.I /var/lib/samba
.RS
Indiestor automatically keeps the users and passwords for the indiestor-users group in sync with samba's users and passwords.
.RE
.I /var/log/syslog:
.RS
indiestor-inotify logs its operations to this file, which is the system log file. You can inspect it with the command:
.RE
.I /etc/shadow
.RS
The system stores the user passwords in this file.

.SH MISCELLANEOUS NOTES

.B Connecting Mac clients to indiestor:
Users should switch to Finder and use Command + K or click Go > connect to server:

afp://<IP-ADDRESS-or-HOST-NAME>/indiestor-mac

Mac users will see a warning that “project settings not saved due to an error”. While this can be midly annoying it is largely cosemtic and only effects the .avp file. In our testing AFP hugely out performs Samba on the Mac platform. For users that wish to use Samba on Mac, they will need a Thursby Dave license (which is a third party samba client for Mac) and to uncomment the “indiestor-mac” share in /etc/samba/smb.conf.

.B Connecting Windows clients to indiestor:
For windows use the built in CIFS/SMB client. Right click on "Computer" then choose Map Network Drive.

All users in a group should agree to map mounts to the same drive letter using the following folder path:

\e\e<IP-ADDRESS-or-HOST-NAME>\eindiestor-win

The 'Connect using different credentials' is handy if windows signs you in automatically.

NB: Windows users must to disable UAC before attempting to use NAS drives with Avid.

.B Enable Avid "All Drives":
this option must be enabled on all client Media Composer workstations, since it enables Media Composer to see NAS based network mounts. You can toggle this on/off by using the console in Media Composer. Tools > Console and type "alldrives 1". In the event that this option is forgotton, media will simply remain offline.

The console should respond with:
 "All drives will be viewed as media drives"

This only has to be set once on each workstation.

.B GENERAL DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION:
Further diagnostic information can be found on the Technical FAQs page at: http://www.indiestor.com/documentation/getting-started/admin-faq


.B Indiestor Graphical User Interface:
You can purchase an elegant graphical user interface for managing indiestor native on our website. This is available for a small one off cost, which will help fund the further development of this project.
