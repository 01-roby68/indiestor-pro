.SH DESCRIPTION
indiestor-pro is a complete shared storage utility. It supports both Avid workspaces, for project and media sharing, as well as generic workspaces - for everything else.

In the case of Avid-workspaces, incron and inotify are used to watch the file system for 'share triggers' (see below). There is very little for the editor to learn and nothing to install on edit workstations. Be aware that this version of indiestor does not attempt to emulate the Avid sharing environment.

.B SHARING PROJECTS:
To share an Avid project an editor must be connected to an Avid workspace. By simply naming a new (or existing) project as follows, the project will be shared: <projectname>.avid

.B NB:
indiestor listens to share triggers on the top level each workspace ONLY.

Upon detection of each
.B .avid
trigger indiestor-free automatically creates and distributes 
.B .copy
versions of the project. The .copy projects can be found in other editors “Avid Shared Projects” folder. Inside each node of the shared project you will find the 'sharing tree', which allows bins to be offered to other editors. An Unprotected folder is provided for conveniently passing bins between editors.

.B SHARING MXF MEDIA:
Media sharing is enabled automatically between the users on a workspace, as soon as media exists in /Avid MediaFiles/MXF. Legacy style OMFI media sharing is not supported at this time.

.B UNSHARING:
The leading editor (.avid owner) can unshare at any time by simply removing the share trigger. For example, by renaming the project folder “episode1.avid" to “episode1" the system will automatically unshare the project. As part of this process the work completed by each editor will be archived into the lead project.


.SH OPTIONS
There are nine entities through which the command line operates:

.IP --users

.B -show:
show list of indiestor-pro users.

.B -json:
JSON export indiestor-pro user list.

.IP --user
.B <arg>

The
.B <arg> -add:
creates/adds a new user.

.B -delete:
removes the specified user from indiestor-pro. This action will remove all assets associated with that user!

.B -pkill:
Pkill terminates all processes relating the selected user. This function is handy in cases that Avid projects cannot be opened due to the warning:"resouce temporarily unavailable"

.B -set-passwd <arg>:
sets/resets the user's password.

.IP --avid-workspace

The
.B <arg> -add <arg>
argument is the name of the workspace you wish to create, followed by the path. In the case of a ZFS target do not specify a leading slash. When we see a ZFS pool a discreet dataset will be created for the workspace.

.B -delete
deletes a specified avid-workspace.

.B -add-user <arg>
Adds an existing user to the specified avid-workspace.

.B -remove-user <arg>
Removes the specified user from the specified avid worksapce. This action will remove all assets associated with that user!

.B -set-zfs-quota <arg>
Set a per ZFS quota (applies to workspace dataset as a whole)

.B -remove-zfs-quota
Removes ZFS quota.

.B -reshare
forcibly refresh all permissions and sharing across the specified workspace.

.B -show-members
shows the memebers of the specified avid-workspace.

.B -json
JSON export specified avid-workspace.

.B NOTE:
Both incron and indistor-pro watching must be running for events to be automatically processed!

.B -show-watches <arg>
Shows the indiestor-pro watch table for specified workspace. Supported arguments are "main" and "avp".

.B -show-watch-processes
Shows indiestor-pro watch processes for speficied workspace. Under normal operation there should be two main threads.

.IP --avid-workspaces

.B -show
Show a list of avid-workspaces and associated memberships.

.B -json 
JSON export all avid-workspaces data.

.IP --generic-workspace

.B <arg> -add <arg>
argument is the name of the workspace you wish to create, followed by the path. In the case of a ZFS target do not specify a leading slash. When we see a ZFS pool a discreet dataset will be created for the workspace.

.B -delete
deletes the specified workspace.

.B -add-write-user
add a write user to the workspace.

.B -remove-write-user
remove a write user from the workspace.

.B -add-read-only-user
add a read-only user to the workspace.

.B -remove-read-only-user
remove a read-only user from the workspace.

.B -set-zfs-quota <arg>
Set a per ZFS quota (applies to workspace dataset as a whole)

.B -remove-zfs-quota
Removes ZFS quota.

.B -show-members
shows the memebers of the specified generic-workspace.

.B -json
JSON export specified generic-workspace.

.IP --generic-workspaces

.B -show
Show a list of generic-workspaces and associated memberships.

.B -json 
JSON export all generic-workspaces data.

.IP --services

.B -start-incron
Start incron service.

.B -stop-incron
Stop incron service.

.B -start-watching
Start indiestor-pro Avid workspace watching.

.B -stop-watching
Stop indiestor-pro Avid workspace watching.

.B -show
Show an overview of service status.

.B -json
Export an overview of service status.

.IP --help
Display a list of commands.

.IP --version

.B -show
Show the version number.

.B -json
JSON export version number.


.SH COMMAND LINE EXAMPLES
It is possible to combine multiple actions for the same entity, for example:

.B indiestor-pro --user john -add -passwd hello

The command above adds “john” to the system and sets his password to "hello". By default, John is not able to login until he is a member of a workspace(s).

Here is an example of adding a workspace, then assigning two users to it:

.B indiestor-pro --avid-workspace test -add tank/test
.B indiestor-pro --avid-workspace test -add-user john
.B indiestor-pro --avid-workspace test -add-user sally


SH FILES
.I /etc/passwd

.RE
.I /etc/group
.RS

.RE
.I /etc/incron.allow
.RS

.RE
.I /etc/init.d/indiestor-pro-watch
.RS
This init.d script starts/stops all watches. It is deployed on installation and positioned to initialise when the system boots.
.RE
.I /etc/super.tab
.RS
This file must have an entry for the indiestor-pro and indiestor-pro-inotify command ensuring that the indiewheel group can operate the indiestor command as root and the indienotify user to operate the indiestor-pro-inotify command as root.
.RE
.I /etc/afp.conf
.RS
Indiestor-pro will deploy its include line in /etc/afp.conf, which points at /etc/indiestor-pro/indie.afp.conf. This assumes you are using the netatalk 3.1.7 package avialble from the free.indiestor.com repository.
.RE

.SH MISCELLANEOUS NOTES

.B Connecting Mac clients to indiestor:
Users should switch to Finder and use Command + K or click Go > connect to server:

afp://<IP-ADDRESS-or-HOST-NAME>/

Mac users should install the "indiestor Avid AFP tuner" from our website, which resoleves the well known "project settings not saved" error.

.B Connecting Windows clients to indiestor:
Right click on "Computer" then choose "Map Network Drive".

In windows environments users should agree to map mounts to the same drive letter using the following folder path(s):

\e\e<IP-ADDRESS-or-HOST-NAME>\eindiestor-free
\e\e<IP-ADDRESS-or-HOST-NAME>\epublic

The 'Connect using different credentials' is handy if windows signs you in automatically.

NB: Windows users must to disable UAC.

.B Enable Avid "All Drives":
this option must be enabled as it allows Avid to use network shares. You can enable it by going into the Avid "Tools" menu, choosing the "Console" option then and typing "alldrives 1".

Hit enter and the console should respond with:
 "All drives will be viewed as media drives"

.B FURTHER DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION:
Further diagnostic information can be found in the technical FAQ's section of our website.
