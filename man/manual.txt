.SH DESCRIPTION
indiestor provides a complete OpenSource solution for Avid project & MXF/AMA media sharing. It takes care of the management of volumes, groups and users (homes, passwords, quotas). Incron is used to trigger the sharing of projects and the patching of Avid MXF media folders.

As such there is no requirement for a client side application, which reduces the learning curve for editors.

To trigger sharing the editor must name a new project or rename an existing project/media directory as follows:

For avid shared projects use:
.B
 <projectname>.avid

For AMA volumes, legacy style FCP projects or anything else use:
.B
 <foldername>.shared

Be aware that indiestor only listens to share trigger requests on the top level of each home directory. You cannot nest shares within folders or sub folders.

In the case of avid shares, upon detecting the
.B .avid
trigger, indiestor will automatically create and distribute a
.B .copy
version of the project to each member of the group. Media sharing is automatically enabled as soon as media exists in /USER/Avid MediaFiles/MXF.

Once inside the project bins are easily exchanged via the 'sharing tree' - a network of folders, which are offered read-only to group members. Upon opening another editors bin we recommend that editors simply drag clips and sequences to their own bins for modification/IN/OUT etc.

As a sanity check indiestor is designed to reject .avid trigger requests for folders without valid .avp files.

.B NB:
At present  users can only be a member of one group at a time. All users in a group will share all projects. The project owner can unshare a project by removing the share trigger.  For example, by renaming the folder "mydocumentary.avid" to "mydocumentary", the project owner will have removed the ".avid" trigger. This will cause indiestor to unshare the "mydocumentary" project. When unsharing a project, Indiestor will archive the members work in the project owner's folder in the "Archived" subfolder.
.SH OPTIONS
There are seven main entities on which indiestor operates:

.B --volumes, --volume, --groups, --group, --users, --user, --help

A command consists in executing an action on an entity. For example, showing all users is done using either of the following:

.B indiestor --users -show

.B indiestor -show --users

All supported entity/action options are listed below:

.IP --volumes

.B -show:
Shows the list of volumes.

.B -purge-fstab-backups:
When enabling quotas, the system modifies the
.B /etc/fstab
file. It will create a dated backup of the existing version of
.B /etc/fstab
in the
.B /etc
folder. Use this action to purge all such backups.

.IP --volume <arg>

The
.B <arg>
argument is the volume name.

Example:
.B /dev/hda1
or
.B /dev/sda1
or other devices available on the system.

.B -quota-on:
Switches on the quota system for the volume.

.B -quota-off:
Switches off the quota system for the volume.

.B -quota-remove:
Removes the entry in
.B /etc/fstab
that enables the quota system for the volume and removes the
.B quota.user
file in the root of the volume's file system.

.IP --groups

.B -show:
Shows the list of indiestor groups. Not all groups listed in
.B /etc/group
are indiestor groups. 

.IP --group <arg>
 
The
.B <arg>
argument must be an indiestor group.

.B -add:
creates a new indiestor group.

.B -delete:
deletes the named indiestor group.

.B -show-members:
shows the users in the named indiestor group.

.IP --users

.B -show:
shows the list of indiestor users.

.B COLUMNS

.B 	user: 
username

.B 	home: 
home directory for the user

.B 	locked: 
Y=yes, N=no

.B 	group: 
indiestor group for the user*

.B 	quota: 
in gigabytes

.B 	used: 
gigabytes of quota used

.B 	%used:
percentage of quota used up

.B 	samba: 
Y=has samba access, N=does not have samba access

.B 	flags: 
samba flags. Normally U=user.

.B 	conn.: 
Currently connected through samba. Y=yes. N=no.

.B -show-incrontab:
shows the list of folders being watched by incron for the user indienotify. See incrontab for the meaning of the columns.

.B  -regenerate-incrontab:
for debugging purposes. If the incrontab seems inconsistent, regenerate it.

*none if the user does not belong to an indiestor group.

.IP --user
.B <arg>

The
.B <arg>
argument must be an indiestor username.

.B -add: 
adds the user named to indiestor. If the user account does not exist, indiestor will create it. If the user exists, but is not an indiestor user, indiestor will add the user to the "indiestor-users" group. By default, indiestor also adds the user to Samba.

.B -delete:
removes the user named from indiestor.

.B -expel:
forcibly logs out the user named from the system.

.B -set-home <arg>:
sets the home directory for the user named to <arg>.

.B -remove-home:
only used in conjuction with the -delete action. In addition to deleting the user account, this option also deletes the user's home folder.

.B -set-group <arg>:
sets the group for the user named to the indiestor group <arg>. This indiestor group must exist already.

.B -unset-group:
removes the user named from his/her current indiestor group.

.B -set-quota  <arg>:
sets the quota for the user named to <arg> gigabytes. Must be a valid number of gigabytes.

.B -remove-quota:
removes the quota for the user and makes his/her quota unlimited.

.B -set-passwd <arg>:
sets the user's password to <arg>.

.B -lock:
locks the account for the user named. This prevents the user from logging in or connecting through samba. The samba flags will contain the "D" flag. The system locks the user by writing "!" in front of the password field of the user's record in the file
.B /etc/shadow
.You can unlock the account by setting the password again with the -set-passwd <arg> action.

.B -add-to-samba:
Adds an existing user to samba. 

.IP --user <arg>:
.B -remove-from-indiestor:
Removes the user <arg> from indiestor. This action cannot be combined with other actions.

.IP --user <arg>:
.B -remove-from-samba:
Removes the user <arg> from samba. This action cannot be combined with other actions.

.IP --help:
Shows the command the synopsis.


.SH EXAMPLES
It is possible to combine multiple actions for the same entity.

For example:

.B indiestor --user john -add -set-group grp1 -set-quota 20 -passwd hello

The command above adds the user "john" to indiestor, to the group "grp1", sets his/her quota to 20 gigabytes and his/her password to "hello". By default, the system will create john's home folder in
.B /home/john
. You can override this default by using the -set-home <arg> option.

.SH FILES
.I /etc/passwd
.RS
This is where the system stores the user records. There is a special user indienotify, which monitors the filesystem through incron.
.RE
.I /etc/group
.RS
This is where the system stores the group records. All indiestor users are registered in the indiestor-users group.
For example, all users for indiestor group "grp1" are registered in the "is_grp1" group. The "is_" prefix stands for "indiestor". special group: The indiewheel group lists the users that are allowed to execute the indiestor command besides the root user.
.RE
.I /etc/incron.allow
.RS
Must list the indienotify user. The indienotify user is the user for which incron watches the filesystem.
.RE
.I /var/spool/incron/indienotify
.RS
The incron table for the indienotify system user. The indiestor and indiestor-inotify commands regenerate this table as needed as a consequence of admin actions or as a consequence of changes in the filesystem monitored. In case of issues, use the --users -regenerate-incrontab option to regenerate this file. You can show the content of the file with the option --users -show-incrontab.
.RE
.I /etc/init.d/indiestor-quota
.RS
This init.d script keeps quotas switched on following a system restart. It can be manually started and stopped using "sudo /etc/init.d/indiestor-quota start/stop"
.RE
.I /srv/indiestor.quota
.RS
Here we maintain a list of volumes with quotas active, this is linked to /etc/init.d/indiestor-quota
.RE
.I /etc/super.tab
.RS
This file must have an entry for the indiestor and indiestor-inotify command ensuring that the indiewheel group can operate the indiestor command as root and the indienotify user to operate the indiestor-inotify command as root.

Use:

.B sudo usermod -a -G indiewheel <username-to-add>

.RE

.SH MISCELLANEOUS NOTES

.B Connecting Mac clients to indiestor:
Users should switch to Finder and use Command + K or click Go > connect to server:

smb://<IP-ADDRESS-or-HOST-NAME>/indiestor-mac

Mac users on 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard) or newer are advised to use the replacement Thursby Dave SMB client to satisfy the needs of Avid Media Composer. We strongly recommend you test this before purchasing Dave. A trail is available at the Thursby site.

.B Connecting Windows clients to indiestor:
For windows use the built in CIFS/SMB client. Right click on "Computer" then choose Map Network Drive.

All users in a group should agree to map mounts to the same drive letter using the following folder path:

\e\e<IP-ADDRESS-or-HOST-NAME>\eindiestor-win

The 'Connect using different credentials' is handy if windows signs you in automatically.

NB: Windows users must to disable UAC.

.B Mixed Mac and Windows projects

This is now possible after some adjustments. Be aware that Windows and Mac clients must connect to the appropriate share point for their OS  -as desribed above.

The following caveats must also be noted:

There is a fundamental difference in the way Windows and Mac clients map network drives. While Windows likes to use drive letters (eg. indiestor mounted as Z:), OS X uses the UNC path (drives should mount as 'indiestor-mac').

In practice when media is imported by an editor on the opposing OS, it will initially appear offline. You can see this by looking at the 'drive' path of the offline media in a bin. Luckily once a bin is closed (then re-opened), Avid refreshes the path by itself. Likewise, closing and opening the whole project will usually refresh all bins.

For the same reason, AMA volumes cannot be shared using the '.shared' trigger on a mixed platform project.

.B Enable Avid "All Drives":
this option must be enabled on all client Media Composer workstations, since it enables Media Composer to see NAS based network mounts. You can toggle this on/off by using the console in Media Composer. Tools > Console and type "alldrives 1". In the event that this option is forgotton, media will simply remain offline.

The console should respond with:
 "All drives will be viewed as media drives"

This only has to be set once on each workstation.

.B Media Creation Settings:
Please take care to ensure Avid "media creation" settings reflect the use of the indiestor drive.
