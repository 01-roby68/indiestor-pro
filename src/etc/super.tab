# This file lists commands that super(1) will execute for you as root.
# Therefore, DO NOT ADD ANY ENTRIES until you understand how this works.
#
# See /usr/share/doc/super/examples for examples on both this file and its
# commands. See the super.tab(5) man page for information.

# Global options =========================================================

:global_options	\
    logfile=/var/log/super.log	# log to this file... \
    renewtime=y			# this says the user doesn't need to re-enter \
				# password if super cmds are issued frequently \
				# (so that we "know" it must be all one user) \
    # patterns=shell		# set user/group/host patterns matching to \
				# Bourne-shell style patterns \
				# (but note it's commented out). \
    # timestampuid=sysmgr	# create timestamp files w/ uid sysmgr \
				# (but note it's commented out). \
    # loguid=sysmgr		# create logfile under uid sysmgr \
				# (but note it's commented out).
