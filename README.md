Building Indiestor Native
=========================

Indiestor native is built, packaged and published using myscriptbox tools (MSB). This allows for the rapid package and publish of .deb's for multiple Debian releases.

If you modify the indiestor source code, you can easily build/publish your own packages by following the documentation at: http://github.com/myscriptbox/

<b>NB:</b> The gpg-man and msb-make pages will be of particular interest.
