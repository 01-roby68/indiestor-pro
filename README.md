Building Indiestor Native from source
=====================================

Indiestor native is now packaged and published using the myscriptbox.org (MSB) developer suite.

MSB tools enable rapid package and publishing for multiple Debian distributions and releases.

To build your own indiestor packages please use the cookbook guide at http://github.com/myscriptbox-org/

NB: The gpg-man and msb-make pages will be of particular interest.
