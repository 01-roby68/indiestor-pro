Building Indiestor Native from source
=====================================

Indiestor native is now packaged and published using the myscriptbox.org (MSB) developer suite.

MSB tools enable rapid package and publish of .deb's for multiple Debian releases.

If you modify the indiestor source code, you can build/publish your own indiestor packages by following the documentation at: http://github.com/myscriptbox-org/

NB: The gpg-man and msb-make pages will be of particular interest.
